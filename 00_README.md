# Interspecies-cell-immortalization-and-proliferative-capacity
Data and code used for the statistical analysis in the article "The spontaneous immortalization probability of mammalian cell culture strains, as their proliferative capacity, correlates with species body mass, not longevity."

The repository contains the following files:
1) "Table for analysis.xlsx", containing the aggregated data from the cell strains in structured form, as used to perform the analysis reported in the paper;
2) "trees.nex", containing 100 phylogenetic trees, used to perform the phylogenetic regression;
3) "01_Import data and trees.R", the R script used to import and preprocess the data contained in "Table for analysis.xlsx" and the trees contained in "trees.nex";
4) "01_Imported data and trees.RData", the R environment obtained by running the script "01_Import data and trees.R";
5) "02_Data analysis population doubling.R", the R script used to perform the analyses about the replicative capacity;
6) "03_Data analysis immortalization rate.R", the R script used to perform the analyses about the immortalization probability.
